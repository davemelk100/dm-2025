        description: "Hiring practices are as egregious as they are insincere.",
        content: `## The Interview Gauntlet

You've probably been there. You apply for a job, and suddenly you're in scheduled for weekly interviews and meaningless discussions. What exactly are we trying to prove here? 

Let's be honest - most of these interviews aren't adding much value. They're often more about process than purpose. We've created elaborate interview rituals that take up everyone's time without necessarily helping us make better decisions. It's not that anyone means to waste time - it's that we've lost sight of what we're actually trying to accomplish.

Think about what we're asking of candidates: taking time off from their current job, preparing for hours of interviews, doing take-home assignments, waiting weeks for feedback, jumping through increasingly absurd hoops. All while we pretend this is normal. It's not.

## A Better Way

Here's a radical idea: what if we actually respected people's time? What if we did our homework before the interview, made decisions quickly, gave real feedback, paid for take-home assignments, and actually knew what we were looking for?

Most hiring decisions are made in the first 15 minutes of the first interview. The rest is just CYA theater. We're not being thorough - we're being indecisive.

If you're running a hiring process, ask yourself: Would I want to go through this process? What are we actually learning in each interview? Could we make this decision faster? Are we treating candidates like humans or like lab rats?

        title: "Vibe Engineering vs Vibe Coding",
        description:
          "The subtle art of making things work right, not just feel right.",
        content: `## The Vibe Check

Look, I know - the word "vibe" makes me cringe too. But stick with me here, because there's something important about how things feel when you use them, even if we have to use a slightly cringey word to talk about it.

After years of building with AI, I've learned that success isn't about the tools - it's about the intent. Vibe engineering isn't (even) another buzzword; it's the difference between slapping features together and crafting something that feels right. It's about understanding that every loading state, every transition, every micro-interaction is a chance to build trust with your users. You're not just coding - you're creating an experience that feels natural, not forced. The personality isn't something you add at the end; it's woven into the fabric of what you're building from day one.

Think of vibe coding like dictating your mental notes to a robot. You're essentially saying "make it feel better" without really understanding why it doesn't feel right in the first place. It's like telling a robot "make this room cozier" instead of actually thinking about what makes a space feel warm and inviting. The robot might add some throw pillows and dim the lights, but it won't understand that the real issue might be the harsh overhead lighting or the cold, sterile furniture.

Maybe we should call it "surface coding" instead of "vibe coding" - it's more honest about what's really happening. You're just coding the surface, the appearance, without touching the underlying structure. Sure, it looks better from the street, but the problems are still there, just hidden under a new layer.

We've seen this for decades with WYSIWYG editors - when something breaks, you're stuck. You can't just pop the proverbial hood and fix it because you never really understood how it worked in the first place. You were just clicking buttons and dragging things around, hoping for the best. Vibe coding is the same trap - you're letting the tool make decisions you don't fully understand, and when those decisions need to be undone or modified, you're left with a mess you can't easily clean up.

And let's talk about token efficiency. Every time you ask AI to fix something you could have figured out yourself, you're burning through tokens and time. It's like calling a plumber to change a light bulb - sure, they can do it, but it's a waste of resources. Learning to troubleshoot your own vibe issues not only saves tokens but makes you a better designer. You start to understand the patterns, the why behind the what, and suddenly you're making fewer requests because you're thinking more deeply about the problems.

When working with AI, this distinction becomes crucial. I've learned the hard way that if you don't specify the right constraints and context upfront, you'll end up with technically correct but fundamentally flawed solutions. It's like telling AI to "make it look better" versus explaining exactly how the user should feel when they interact with it.

The real skill isn't just knowing when to use vibe coding - it's knowing when to undo it. Sometimes you'll start down a path of quick fixes and realize you're just making things worse. That's when you need to step back, undo those changes, and take the time to engineer the solution properly. Other times, you'll find that a small vibe coding tweak is exactly what you need to push something from good to great.

Vibe engineering feels natural and solves real problems. It's about the user and builds trust. Vibe coding feels forced and often just hides problems. It's more about the developer than the user experience.

Next time you're building something, ask yourself: am I engineering the vibe, or am I just coding it? Because in the end, users don't care about your clever solutions - they care about how it feels to use your product. And if you're using AI to help build it, make sure you're asking for the right kind of help.

          "How to spot, handle, and stop the AI needle from skipping.",
        content: `## The AI Confidence Trap

You know that feeling when your AI assistant sounds super confident about something, but you're pretty sure it's making it up? That's a hallucination - when AI confidently presents false information as fact. It's like that friend who always has an answer, even when they're completely wrong.

When you catch an AI hallucinating, call it out directly: "I think you might be hallucinating here." Ask for sources or citations, break the problem into smaller pieces, give it more context. If all else fails, start fresh with a new conversation.

## The Practical Guide

The best way to prevent hallucinations is to be specific about what you need, provide relevant context, ask for step-by-step reasoning, request sources or citations upfront, and use follow-up questions to verify information.

Remember, AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment. When something feels off, trust your gut. The best AI interactions happen when we work together - you bring the critical thinking, and the AI brings the processing power.

Here's a hard truth: even when AI gives you exactly what you asked for, you still need to test it. Every time. I've seen AI-generated code that looked perfect but broke existing functionality. That's why regression testing is non-negotiable - especially when working with AI. It's not about distrusting the AI; it's about respecting the complexity of the systems we're building.

One of the trickiest parts of working with AI is knowing when to be specific and when to be vague. Need a specific implementation? Be precise with your requirements. Looking for creative solutions? Leave some room for the AI to surprise you. It's like the difference between asking for "a blue button" versus "something that draws attention to this action." Sometimes the AI's interpretation is better than what you had in mind.

Here's something I've learned the hard way: multi-step changes are risky. When you ask AI to make several changes at once, it's like playing a game of telephone - each step can introduce new errors or misunderstandings. Instead, break complex changes into single, focused steps. Test each step before moving to the next. It might feel slower, but it's much faster than fixing a cascade of issues later.

## Moving Forward

Hallucinations aren't going away anytime soon. They're part of how these models work. The key is to develop a healthy skepticism and know how to work around them. Think of it like proofreading - you don't trust spell check completely, you use it as a tool.

        title: "Users Don't Ask Much of Us",
        description: "Successful design is often less complex than we think.",
        content: `## The Bare Minimum

Users don't ask for much. They just want to get their stuff done without thinking about it. No one wakes up thinking, "I can't wait to use that new app today!" They wake up thinking, "I need to get this thing done, and hopefully it won't be a pain in the ass."

## What Users Actually Want

Let's be real - users want:
- Stuff that works
- Stuff that's fast
- Stuff that doesn't make them feel stupid

That's it. That's the list. They don't care about your fancy animations, your clever micro-interactions, or your beautiful typography. They care about getting from point A to point B without getting lost or frustrated.

## The Great Disconnect

We spend hours debating button colors, animation timings, and interaction patterns. Meanwhile, users are just trying to find the "submit" button. We obsess over the perfect shade of blue, while they're wondering why the form keeps resetting when they hit back.

## The Real Challenge

The hardest part of design isn't making things beautiful - it's making them invisible. The best interfaces are the ones users don't even notice. They just work, and that's all anyone really wants.

## A Modest Proposal

Maybe instead of trying to wow users with our design skills, we should focus on not making them think. Stop trying to be clever. Stop trying to be different. Just be clear, be fast, and be reliable.

That's not to say we shouldn't care about aesthetics. But let's get the basics right first. Make it work. Make it fast. Make it obvious. Then, if you must, make it pretty.

You know that feeling when you have a great idea, but getting it into something you can actually show people takes forever? Bolt.new does. It's like having a superpower for turning ideas into real things, fast.

bolt.new isn't just quick - it's that it looks good while being quick. The interface is slick, everything moves smoothly, and the CTAs know what I want before I do. Sure, it can get a bit sluggish when you're pushing it hard - we're talking about AI here, after all - but that's a small price to pay for what it gives you in return.

Remember when you had to juggle a bunch of different tools? One for rough sketches, another for fancy designs, and something else for making it interactive? Bolt.new puts all that in one place. You're not just saving time - you're saving your sanity by not having to switch between a million different apps.

And let's talk about the CSS headaches it eliminates. No more wrestling with custom select boxes or trying to create the perfect chevron handle. No more spending hours tweaking dropdown animations or fighting with cross-browser compatibility. Bolt.new handles all those tedious details for you, letting you focus on what actually matters - building something great.

## The Real Magic

The best part about bolt.new isn't the tech - it's how it changes the way you talk about ideas. Instead of trying to explain what you're thinking, you can just show it. That changes everything about how you get feedback and make things better.

## Looking Forward

Tools like bolt.new aren't just about speed - they're about making better stuff. When you can focus on solving problems instead of fighting with your tools, that's when the real magic happens.

And the best part? This is just the start. As bolt.new keeps getting better, we're seeing a future where the line between design and development gets blurrier - and that's exactly what we need.

        content: `## Your IA Shouldn't Be Set in Stone

The UX process is iterative by nature. You design something, test it, learn from it, and then do it all over again. It's not a straight path, and your information architecture shouldn't be either. When real feedback shows that people are missing something, you move it. When analytics show that users are skipping entire sections, you streamline. The structure should serve the user, not hold them back.

## Investing in User Testing

A user testing platform subscription costs less than your office snacks budget, yet provides invaluable insights into how users navigate your information architecture. It's a small investment that helps prevent the much larger cost of losing potential customers due to poor content organization.

Your users aren't just numbers in a database, they're partners in your product's journey. Their navigation patterns, content discovery struggles, and information-seeking behaviors should directly inform your IA decisions.

The real question isn't what your users are worth to you - it's what you're willing to invest to truly understand how they think about and organize your content.

Cutting corners on IA doesn't just affect numbers on a dashboard. You're losing real people. Think about it: if your product has 10,000 users and each one takes just 10 seconds to decide they can't find what they're looking for, that's 10,000 potential customers walking away. What's that worth to you?

## Beyond the Bottom Line

Yes, business needs to make money. And the best businesses understand that user value and business value aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, they're deeply connected. When you invest in understanding and serving your users better, you're not just doing the right thing - you're making a smart business decision.

Every interaction with your product is an opportunity to build or break trust. When users feel understood and valued, they become your biggest advocates. They'll stick with you through rough patches and bring others along. That kind of loyalty is priceless.

## Build for Real Behavior

The best organizations don't let ego or outdated documents dictate the user experience. They know great UX means anticipating what the user needs - sometimes before they even know it themselves - and meeting them there.

So go ahead: break your own architecture if it makes the experience better. That's not sloppy - it's smart. It's a living system that should evolve with your users. Keep it flexible. Keep it human.

Design, like music, has its genres. And just like you wouldn't play death metal at a jazz club, you need to match your design to your audience's expectations. 

Unless you're Jackson Pollock or Andy Warhol, users aren't there to see your personal creative endeavors. They have something they need done, and likely don't even feel like doing it.

Artists get into trouble when they make art to impress other artists. Designers get into trouble when they make products to impress other designers.


Don't get me wrong - make sure my tombstone text is Helvetica, but if my user wants Comic Sans, I'm going to give them all the Comic Sans they can handle.

## The Power of Genre Awareness

Having a niche audience is a gift. You know exactly who your users are and what they expect. This deep understanding creates natural empathy - your users can feel when you truly get them.

Shoe-horning in your personal creative signature can damage your product in ways that aren't even tangible. Most users don't want King Crimson. They might tolerate Radiohead, but they really just want AC/DC. And if we don't give them AC/DC, then shame on us.

This isn't selling out or pandering - you have been blessed with an audience and they have expectations. Our product needs to map to their expectations. The genre isn't one of our choosing; it's a hand we've been fortunate enough to have been dealt.

        content: `Google's Stitch project is giving us a peek into how AI might completely transform how we create.

It's eerily close to *thinking* a design into existence.

It creates actual Figma objects you can copy and paste directly into your Figma files. For teams living in Figma, this is a total game-changer.

While Stitch isn't exactly mindblowingly creative yet - you can see where it's going. The way it understands context and provides granularity is clearly indicative of its direction. The agent's UI is already a step above many of the top dogs in today's race.

Tools like Stitch are showing us a future where AI and human creativity work together. It's not about AI taking over - it's about giving us superpowers to do what we do best: think creatively, solve problems, and really understand what users need.

The trick is finding that sweet spot between AI help and human creativity. Stitch is showing us that the future isn't about choosing between human and AI - it's about using both to make something better than either could do alone.
