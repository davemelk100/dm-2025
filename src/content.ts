        description:
          "Examining modern hiring practices and their impact on both candidates and organizations.",
        content: `Seven Interviews?

## The Interview Process

Extended interview processes have become the norm: multiple rounds, repeated discussions, and lengthy timelines. While thorough evaluation is important, the current approach often prioritizes procedure over meaningful assessment. How many times should a candidate have to answer "tell me about yourself" before someone takes notes?

After experiencing seven rounds of interviews for a single position, the question becomes clear: what value does each additional interview add? Thankfully, I didn't have to endure this process myself - I've heard enough horror stories from colleagues and friends to know it's a widespread issue that needs addressing.

## A More Efficient Approach

What if the hiring process was reimagined with respect for everyone's time? What if organizations:

- Conducted thorough research before interviews

- Made decisions promptly

- Provided meaningful feedback

- Clearly defined requirements upfront

Research suggests that most hiring decisions are made within the first 15 minutes of the initial interview. The subsequent rounds often serve more as validation than discovery.

## The Cost of Ineffective Hiring

Poor hiring decisions are expensive. Beyond the interview process, organizations face significant costs when a candidate is hired but later terminated due to skill mismatches: onboarding expenses, lost productivity, and the cost of starting the recruitment process again.

For hiring managers, consider: 

- Would you want to experience this process? 

- What insights are gained from each interview? 

- Could decisions be made faster? 

- Are candidates being treated with respect?

The best hiring processes are those that efficiently identify the right candidate while treating everyone involved with dignity and respect.

        description:
          "The subtle art of making things work right, not just feel right.",
        content: `Vibe Coding vs Vibe Engineering

## The Vibe Check

The word "vibe" might make you cringe, but there's something important about how things feel when you use them. Vibe engineering isn't another buzzword - it's the difference between making something feel right and making it work right. Every interaction is a chance to build trust with users.

THINK of vibe coding like telling a robot "make this room cozier" instead of understanding what makes a space feel warm. The robot might add throw pillows and dim the lights, but it won't understand that the real issue might be the harsh lighting or cold furniture.

## The Real Difference

When working with AI, this distinction is crucial. If you don't specify the right constraints upfront, you'll end up with technically correct but fundamentally flawed solutions. It's like telling AI to "make it look better" versus explaining exactly how the user should feel.

This is where real UI development experience pays off. You can tell AI to "add a 2px border with rounded corners" instead of just saying "make it pop." This precision saves time and leads to better results.

Vibe engineering solves real problems while feeling natural. Vibe coding makes things feel right but might miss the underlying issues. Next time you're building something, ask yourself: am I engineering the vibe, or am I just coding it?

        description:
          "How to spot, handle, and stop the AI needle from skipping.",
        content: `AI Hallucination Prevention

## The AI Confidence Trap

You know that feeling when your AI assistant sounds super confident about something, but you're pretty sure it's making it up? That's a hallucination - when AI confidently presents false information as fact. It's like that friend who always has an answer, even when they're completely wrong.

When you catch an AI hallucinating, call it out directly: "I think you might be hallucinating here." Ask for sources or citations, break the problem into smaller pieces, give it more context. If all else fails, start fresh with a new conversation.

## The Practical Guide

The best way to prevent hallucinations is to be specific about what you need, provide relevant context, ask for step-by-step reasoning, request sources or citations upfront, and use follow-up questions to verify information.

Remember, it's not just what you ask - it's how you ask it. Telling AI to "create a login form" might get you something that looks right but doesn't actually work. Instead, try "create a login form with email validation, password requirements, and error handling for invalid credentials." The more specific your request, the less room there is for the AI to fill in the gaps with made-up details. It's like the difference between asking someone to "make it look nice" versus "use a 16px font size with 1.5 line height and 24px margins."

Here's a hard truth: even when AI gives you exactly what you asked for, you still need to test it. Every time. I've seen AI-generated code that looked perfect but broke existing functionality. That's why regression testing is non-negotiable - especially when working with AI. It's not about distrusting the AI; it's about respecting the complexity of the systems we're building.

One of the trickiest parts of working with AI is knowing when to be specific and when to be vague. Need a specific implementation? Be precise with your requirements. Looking for creative solutions? Leave some room for the AI to surprise you. It's like the difference between asking for "a blue button" versus "something that draws attention to this action." Sometimes the AI's interpretation is better than what you had in mind.

Here's something I've learned the hard way: multi-step changes are risky. When you ask AI to make several changes at once, it's like playing a game of telephone - each step can introduce new errors or misunderstandings. Instead, break complex changes into single, focused steps. Test each step before moving to the next. It might feel slower, but it's much faster than fixing a cascade of issues later.

## Moving Forward

Hallucinations aren't going away anytime soon. They're part of how these models work. The key is to develop a healthy skepticism and know how to work around them. THINK of it like proofreading - you don't trust spell check completely, you use it as a tool.

        title: "Users Don't Ask Much of Us",
        description: "Successful design is often less complex than we think.",
        content: `Users Don't Ask Much of Us

## The Bare Minimum

Users don't ask for much. They just want to get their stuff done without thinking about it. No one wakes up thinking, "I can't wait to use that new app today!" They wake up thinking, "I need to get this thing done, and hopefully it won't be a pain in the ass."

## What Users Actually Want

Let's be real - users want:

- Stuff that works

- Stuff that's fast

- Stuff that doesn't make them feel stupid

That's it. That's the list. They don't care about your fancy animations, your clever micro-interactions, or your beautiful typography. They care about getting from point A to point B without getting lost or frustrated.

## The Great Disconnect

We spend hours debating button colors, animation timings, and interaction patterns. Meanwhile, users are just trying to find the "submit" button. We obsess over the perfect shade of blue, while they're wondering why the form keeps resetting when they hit back.

## The Real Challenge

The hardest part of design isn't making things beautiful - it's making them invisible. The best interfaces are the ones users don't even notice. They just work, and that's all anyone really wants.

## A Modest Proposal

Maybe instead of trying to wow users with our design skills, we should focus on not making them think. Stop trying to be clever. Stop trying to be different. Just be clear, be fast, and be reliable.

That's not to say we shouldn't care about aesthetics. But let's get the basics right first. Make it work. Make it fast. Make it obvious. Then, if you must, make it pretty.

## The Speed of Thought

You know that feeling when you have a great idea, but getting it into something you can actually show people takes forever? Bolt.new is like having a superpower for turning ideas into real things, fast.

The interface is slick, everything moves smoothly, and it looks good while being quick. Sure, it can get a bit sluggish when you're pushing it hard - we're talking about AI here - but that's a small price to pay for what it gives you in return.

## The Real Magic

The best part about bolt.new isn't the tech - it's how it changes the way you talk about ideas. Instead of trying to explain what you're thinking, you can just show it. That changes everything about how you get feedback and make things better.

## Looking Forward

Tools like bolt.new aren't just about speed - they're about making better stuff. When you can focus on solving problems instead of fighting with your tools, that's when the real magic happens.

And the best part? This is just the start. As bolt.new keeps getting better, we're seeing a future where the line between design and development gets blurrier - and that's exactly what we need.

          "Your IA should evolve with your users, not stay set in stone.",
        content: `Information Architecture Is Not Sacred

## Your IA Shouldn't Be Set in Stone

The UX process is iterative by nature. You design something, test it, learn from it, and then do it all over again. It's not a straight path, and your information architecture shouldn't be either. When real feedback shows that people are missing something, you move it. When analytics show that users are skipping entire sections, you streamline. The structure should serve the user, not hold them back.

## Investing in User Testing

A user testing platform subscription costs less than your office snacks budget, yet provides invaluable insights into how users navigate your information architecture. It's a small investment that helps prevent the much larger cost of losing potential customers due to poor content organization.

Your users aren't just numbers in a database, they're partners in your product's journey. Their navigation patterns, content discovery struggles, and information-seeking behaviors should directly inform your IA decisions.

The real question isn't what your users are worth to you - it's what you're willing to invest to truly understand how they think about and organize your content.

Cutting corners on IA doesn't just affect numbers on a dashboard. You're losing real people. THINK about it: if your product has 10,000 users and each one takes just 10 seconds to decide they can't find what they're looking for, that's 10,000 potential customers walking away. What's that worth to you?

## Beyond the Bottom Line

Yes, business needs to make money. And the best businesses understand that user value and business value aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, they're deeply connected. When you invest in understanding and serving your users better, you're not just doing the right thing - you're making a smart business decision.

Every interaction with your product is an opportunity to build or break trust. When users feel understood and valued, they become your biggest advocates. They'll stick with you through rough patches and bring others along. That kind of loyalty is priceless.

## Build for Real Behavior

The best organizations don't let ego or outdated documents dictate the user experience. They know great UX means anticipating what the user needs - sometimes before they even know it themselves - and meeting them there.

So go ahead: break your own architecture if it makes the experience better. That's not sloppy - it's smart. It's a living system that should evolve with your users. Keep it flexible. Keep it human.

          "When your users want AC/DC, don't give them King Crimson.",
        content: `Design Genres

When your product performs, who is watching? And why are they there in the first place? 

Design, like music, has its genres. And just like you wouldn't play death metal at a jazz club, you need to match your design to your audience's expectations. 

Unless you're Jackson Pollock or Andy Warhol, users aren't there to see your personal creative endeavors. They have something they need done, and likely don't even feel like doing it.

Artists get into trouble when they make art to impress other artists. Designers get into trouble when they make products to impress other designers.


Don't get me wrong - make sure my tombstone text is Helvetica, but if my user wants Comic Sans, I'm going to give them all the Comic Sans they can handle.

## The Power of Genre Awareness

Having a niche audience is a gift. You know exactly who your users are and what they expect. This deep understanding creates natural empathy - your users can feel when you truly get them.

Shoe-horning in your personal creative signature can damage your product in ways that aren't even tangible. Most users don't want King Crimson. They might tolerate Radiohead, but they really just want AC/DC. And if we don't give them AC/DC, then shame on us.

This isn't selling out or pandering - you have been blessed with an audience and they have expectations. Our product needs to map to their expectations. The genre isn't one of our choosing; it's a hand we've been fortunate enough to have been dealt.

This was fun the first time around, so let's go ahead and run it back, this time with more details.
And an acronym. And more guitars.

Why do we need utilitarian names for types of design? Because we don't have any yet. At least none that are any fun. So let's make some up.

## 1. DENSE

Users expect power, control, and maximum information density through heavy, complex interfaces with dense information, dark themes, high contrast, and industrial aesthetics.

THINK: Bloomberg Terminal, Trading Platforms

SAY: "The admin panel is getting too Dense - maybe we should split these controls into separate views?"

LISTEN: Prog (Mahavishnu Orchestra, Yes, King Crimson) - complex, intense, and information-rich

## 2. ROUTINE

Users expect speed, clarity, and getting things done through simple, straightforward, and functional designs featuring neutral colors, clear typography, and minimal decoration.

THINK: Google Search, Wikipedia, Craigslist, Microsoft Office

SAY: "The settings page needs to be more Routine - users just want to change their preferences and move on."

LISTEN: Noise (Shellac, Helmet, Neu!) - brutish, authentic, and purposeful

## 3. IMMERSE

Users expect excitement, community, and visual impact through bold, energetic, and immersive designs featuring dark themes, neon accents, and dynamic elements.

THINK: Discord, Steam, Twitch

SAY: "Let's commit to being more Immerse - can we add spatial audio?"

LISTEN: Big Indie (The Flaming Lips, Sloan, Broken Social Scene) - energetic, engaging, and delightful

## 4. SUITE

Users expect innovation, personality, and modern features through bold, playful, and slightly experimental designs featuring bright colors, custom illustrations, and micro-interactions.

THINK: Slack, Notion, Figma

SAY: "The empty states could use some Suite intuition - let's try more predicitive micro-interactions."

LISTEN: Experimental Indie (Guided By Voices, Deerhunter, Neutral Milk Hotel) - creative, unique, but still approachable

## 5. STRIPPED

Users expect quality, exclusivity, and attention to detail through minimal, sophisticated, and carefully crafted designs featuring monochromatic color schemes, ample whitespace, and subtle animations.

THINK: Apple, Bang & Olufsen

SAY: "The product page feels cluttered - let's go more Stripped for the next iteration."

LISTEN: Post Rock (Radiohead, Tortoise, Slint) - sophisticated, nuanced, and refined

## Do Genres Matter?

These design genres aren't just fancy labels - they're a powerful shared language that helps teams make better decisions. When someone says "this interface needs to be more familiar and reliable" or "let's make this experience more playful and experimental," they're not just talking about colors and fonts. They're communicating a complete vision of how the product should feel and function.

Think of it like a movie soundtrack. The right music doesn't just play in the background - it shapes how you experience the entire film. In the same way, choosing the right design genre shapes how users experience your product. It's about creating harmony between what users expect, what your business needs, and how people feel when they use your product.

          "How the concept of tokens in modern API usage echoes the arcade culture of the 1980s.",
        content: `## The Token Economy

Remember walking into an arcade with a pocket full of quarters, ready to exchange them for tokens? That familiar clink of metal against metal, the anticipation of gameplay ahead. Fast forward to today, and we're still using tokens - just in a different form. API tokens have become the digital equivalent of those arcade tokens, and the parallels are striking.

## The Arcade Experience

In the 1980s, arcades were temples of gaming. You'd walk in with cash, exchange it for tokens, and each token represented a chance to play. One token, one game. It was simple, it was fair, and it was universal. Whether you were playing Galaga or Pole Position, the token system was the same.

## The Modern Digital Arcade

Today's API tokens work in much the same way. Instead of physical tokens, we have digital ones. Instead of games, we're accessing services. But the fundamental concept remains:

- One token, one request

- Limited supply (rate limits)

- Universal currency (standardized authentication)

- Clear value exchange

## The Psychology of Tokens

What's fascinating is how both systems tap into the same psychological principles. Physical tokens made the cost of play visible, just as API tokens make the cost of service usage visible. Arcades used tokens to manage access to games, while APIs use tokens to manage access to services. Whether you were in New York or Los Angeles, arcade tokens worked the same way, and API tokens work the same way across different services.

## The Evolution of Token Systems

The arcade token system evolved from simple mechanical devices to sophisticated electronic systems. Similarly, API tokens have evolved from basic authentication to complex systems with:

- Rate limiting

- Usage tracking

- Permission scoping

- Expiration dates

## Lessons from the Arcade

The arcade token system taught us valuable lessons about user experience. The system had to be immediately understandable, with everyone playing by the same rules. You always knew how many tokens you had left, and you knew instantly if your token was accepted. The limited supply meant you had to use your tokens wisely, and there was always a clear value exchange - you knew exactly what you were getting for your tokens.

These same principles apply to modern API token systems. The best API implementations maintain this simplicity while adding necessary security and control.

## The Future of Tokens

Just as arcade tokens evolved into digital gaming currencies, API tokens are evolving into more sophisticated systems. But the core concept remains the same: a simple, universal way to exchange value for service.

The next time you're implementing an API token system, remember the arcade. Sometimes the best solutions are the ones that have stood the test of time, just dressed in digital clothes.

        content: `## The 5 Design Anti-Patterns

Let's just make this clear right away - these aren't just bad designs, they're anti-patterns: common mistakes that actively work against good user experience. This is the definitive list of design anti-patterns, according to me.

## 1. NAVBLINDING

Users shouldn't need Waze to use your app. When your navigation is more of a puzzle than a tool, you're not paying attention to your users. Let's not kid ourselves; icons are great, but words are better. Or use both. Go nuts.

## 2. UPSHELLING

You're reading an article, watching a video, or trying to use a feature - next thing you know, you just got horse-collared by a paywall. Every interaction is another chance to bully you into a paid tier. But sometimes that's the point. Based? Yes. Annoying? Absolutely.

## 3. XHUNTING

The modern equivalent of desktop pop-up infection, but on a phone we've learned to tolerate it. Each modal more important and elusive than the last, suddenly you're tapping microscopic X's in order to hide an ad, simply to see the caption on a Reel.

## 4. PAGEJACKING

When you click something and... nothing happens. No loading indicator, no feedback, just a blank stare from your screen. Not even a "thanks for coming". Oh and what about onboarding tutorials? We all love those, right? When your pages don't respond to user actions, your user wants to jump out a window. 

## 5. FORMLOCKING

When there's no way to track progress or retrieve previous data, well, it's super annoying. When your signup form is more complicated than your actual product, you're ignoring decades of UX research on form usability.

That's it. That's the article.`,
