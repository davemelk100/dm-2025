        content: `Google's Stitch project is giving us a peek into how AI might completely transform how we create.

It's eerily close to *thinking* a design into existence.

It creates actual Figma objects you can copy and paste directly into your Figma files. For teams living in Figma, this is a total game-changer.

While Stitch isn't exactly mindblowingly creative yet - you can see where it's going. The way it understands context and provides granularity is clearly indicative of its direction. The agent's UI is already a step above many of the top dogs in today's race.

Tools like Stitch are showing us a future where AI and human creativity work together. It's not about AI taking over - it's about giving us superpowers to do what we do best: think creatively, solve problems, and really understand what users need.

The trick is finding that sweet spot between AI help and human creativity. Stitch is showing us that the future isn't about choosing between human and AI - it's about using both to make something better than either could do alone.

        content: `When your product performs, who is watching? And why are they there in the first place? 

Unless you're Jackson Pollock or Andy Warhol, users aren't there to see your personal creative endeavors. They have something they need done, and likely don't even feel like doing it.

Artists get into trouble when they make art to impress other artists. Designers get into trouble when they make products to impress other designers.

I mean, make sure my tombstone text is Helvetica, but if my user wants Comic Sans, I'm going to give them all the Comic Sans they can handle.

## The Power of Genre Awareness

Having a niche audience is a gift. You know exactly who your users are and what they expect. This deep understanding creates natural empathy - your users can feel when you truly get them.

Shoe-horning in your personal creative signature can damage your product in ways that aren't even tangible. Most users don't want King Crimson. They might tolerate Radiohead, but they really just want AC/DC. And if we don't give them AC/DC, then shame on us.

This isn't selling out or pandering - you have been blessed with an audience and they have expectations. Our product needs to map to their expectations. The genre isn't one of our choosing; it's a hand we've been fortunate enough to have been dealt.

        description:
          "Your IA should evolve with your users, not stay set in stone.",
        content: `## Your IA Shouldn't Be Set in Stone

The UX process is iterative by nature. You design something, test it, learn from it, and then do it all over again. It's not a straight path, and your information architecture shouldn't be either. When real feedback shows that people are missing something, you move it. When analytics show that users are skipping entire sections, you streamline. The structure should serve the user, not hold them back.

## Investing in User Testing

A user testing platform subscription costs less than your office snacks budget, yet provides invaluable insights into how users navigate your information architecture. It's a small investment that helps prevent the much larger cost of losing potential customers due to poor content organization.

Your users aren't just numbers in a database, they're partners in your product's journey. Their navigation patterns, content discovery struggles, and information-seeking behaviors should directly inform your IA decisions.

The real question isn't what your users are worth to you - it's what you're willing to invest to truly understand how they think about and organize your content.

Cutting corners on IA doesn't just affect numbers on a dashboard. You're losing real people. Think about it: if your product has 10,000 users and each one takes just 10 seconds to decide they can't find what they're looking for, that's 10,000 potential customers walking away. What's that worth to you?

## Beyond the Bottom Line

Yes, business needs to make money. And the best businesses understand that user value and business value aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, they're deeply connected. When you invest in understanding and serving your users better, you're not just doing the right thing - you're making a smart business decision.

Every interaction with your product is an opportunity to build or break trust. When users feel understood and valued, they become your biggest advocates. They'll stick with you through rough patches and bring others along. That kind of loyalty is priceless.

## Build for Real Behavior

The best organizations don't let ego or outdated documents dictate the user experience. They know great UX means anticipating what the user needs - sometimes before they even know it themselves - and meeting them there.

So go ahead: break your own architecture if it makes the experience better. That's not sloppy - it's smart. It's a living system that should evolve with your users. Keep it flexible. Keep it human.

        content: `## The Speed of Thought

You know that feeling when you have a great idea, but getting it into something you can actually show people takes forever? Bolt.new does. It's like having a superpower for turning ideas into real things, fast.

bolt.new isn't just quick - it's that it looks good while being quick. The interface is slick, everything moves smoothly, and the CTAs know what I want before I do.

Remember when you had to juggle a bunch of different tools? One for rough sketches, another for fancy designs, and something else for making it interactive? Bolt.new puts all that in one place. You're not just saving time - you're saving your sanity by not having to switch between a million different apps.

## The Real Magic

The best part about bolt.new isn't the tech - it's how it changes the way you talk about ideas. Instead of trying to explain what you're thinking, you can just show it. That changes everything about how you get feedback and make things better.

## Looking Forward

Tools like bolt.new aren't just about speed - they're about making better stuff. When you can focus on solving problems instead of fighting with your tools, that's when the real magic happens.

And the best part? This is just the start. As bolt.new keeps getting better, we're seeing a future where the line between design and development gets blurrier - and that's exactly what we need.
